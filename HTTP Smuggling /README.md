# Understanding HTTP Smuggling (Educational)

HTTP smuggling is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs due to discrepancies in how HTTP requests are interpreted by different entities (e.g., front-end and back-end servers). This README aims to provide a basic understanding of HTTP smuggling, its impact, and how to mitigate it.

## What is HTTP Smuggling?

HTTP smuggling leverages inconsistencies between the handling of HTTP requests by various servers or intermediaries (like proxies or load balancers) to smuggle malicious HTTP requests through to a backend server, which can lead to various security issues like bypassing security controls, obtaining sensitive information, or even remote code execution.

## Example

The provided example below demonstrates a simplified HTTP smuggling attack:

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.77:5002
...
X-Transfer-Encoding:chunked
X-Content-Length: 69
Content-Length: 57

0

POST /login HTTP/1.1
X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE
...
```

In this scenario, the attacker manipulates headers to confuse the intermediary and backend server about where one request ends and the next begins.

## How to Mitigate

1. **Normalize HTTP Requests**: Ensure all intermediaries and backend servers agree on the format of valid HTTP requests.
2. **Use Latest Software**: Keep all servers and web proxies updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
3. **Employ Web Application Firewalls**: Configure firewalls to filter out malicious or malformed requests.
4. **Regular Security Auditing**: Conduct regular security audits to discover and fix potential vulnerabilities.
